# Smart Contracts Collection
A collection of basic, gas-efficient smart contracts built with Solidity and Foundry. These contracts are designed to be simple, educational, and require no ETH deposits (only gas fees for transactions).

## 🎯 Project Goals
- Create simple smart contracts for learning and portfolio purposes
- No complex DeFi mechanics or ETH deposits required
- Focus on core Solidity patterns and best practices
- Built using Foundry framework for testing and deployment

## 📋 Contract Categories
### Data Storage Contracts
Store and manage user information on-chain without requiring payments.
### Social/Community Contracts
Enable community interactions and social features.
### Utility/Registry Contracts
Provide useful registry and tracking functionality.
### Educational/Demo Contracts
Demonstrate core Solidity concepts and patterns.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- Solidity ^0.8.19 - Smart contract language
- Foundry - Development framework
- OpenZeppelin (when needed) - Security standards

## 🔧 Contract Features
### Common Patterns Used

- Struct-based data organization
- Mapping for efficient lookups
- Event emission for frontend integration
- Input validation and error handling
- Gas-efficient storage patterns

### Security Considerations

- Input validation on all public functions
- Access control where appropriate
- Protection against common vulnerabilities
- Safe arithmetic operations

## 📊 Gas Efficiency
All contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:

- Minimal storage operations
- Efficient data structures
- Batch operations where possible
- No unnecessary computations
